# LearnEye – Innovative AI Course Generator for Adaptive Learning

LearnEye is an AI-powered adaptive learning platform that dynamically generates personalized courses and automatically adjusts the learning path based on a learner’s performance. Unlike traditional static courses, LearnEye adapts in real time to improve understanding and engagement.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Most online learning platforms deliver the same content to every learner, regardless of their knowledge level. This often leads to confusion for beginners and boredom for advanced learners.

LearnEye solves this problem by using **Adaptive AI**, where:
- Courses are generated dynamically
- Learners are evaluated through quizzes
- Future lessons are adjusted automatically based on performance

---

## 🎯 Key Features

- User onboarding with learner persona  
- AI-generated course modules  
- Quiz-based evaluation after each module  
- Adaptive learning path (difficulty adjusts automatically)  
- Progress persistence using localStorage  
- Clean and intuitive user interface

## 🧠 What Makes LearnEye Adaptive?

LearnEye does not follow a fixed syllabus.

**Adaptive logic flow:**
1. AI generates a personalized course
2. Learner completes a quiz
3. System evaluates quiz performance
4. Next lesson is adjusted automatically:
   - Good performance → more advanced content
   - Weak performance → simplified explanations and reinforcement

This creates a personalized learning experience for every user.
